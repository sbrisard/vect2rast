## Installation

### Installation of the C library

First install

- the [Meson build system](https://mesonbuild.com/)

Clone the repository of the project

```
git clone https://github.com/sbrisard/voxelize.git
```

and `cd` into the `src` directory

cd voxelize/src
meson build
cd build
ninja install
```

meson -Dprefix=voxelize/installation/directory build
```

To run the tests, stay in the `build/` subdirectory and run the following
command
